<p style="color:#fffdd0"><font size="5">You start off in the bay allocated for you on the yard. For the first explanation, let's assume that you are on the left of the bay and you want to reverse in (look at the diagram). For anyone who lives in a country where you drive on the right hand side of the road, the instructions will follow later <p/>
